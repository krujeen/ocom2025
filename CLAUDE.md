# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This appears to be a newly initialized Git repository with minimal content. The repository currently contains:

- `.gitattributes` - Standard Git configuration for text file normalization
- No source code, build configuration, or documentation files yet

## Development Setup

Since this is an empty repository, there are no established development commands or build processes yet. Future development will require:

1. Determining the project type and technology stack
2. Adding appropriate configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
3. Setting up build, test, and lint commands
4. Establishing project structure and architecture

## Notes for Future Development

- The repository uses LF line ending normalization via `.gitattributes`
- No programming language or framework has been established yet
- No existing code patterns or architectural decisions to follow
